# Project Introduction
This challenge is aimed to explore the dataset, build a prediction model from it and then create a Python module that serves the model. There will be two main tasks:

1. A Jupyter Notebook containing all your experiments, analyzes, and results. In this notebook, you will perform all your visualizations, data normalizations, training and evaluation of your model.

2. A complete Python module ready to be used containing the model you trained. This module should contain usage instructions and a clear interface (generally speaking) to access your model.
