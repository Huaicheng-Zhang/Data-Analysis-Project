    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\"My_prediction\" is a machine learning prediction module based on Decision Tree and designed for predicting projects' state (successful/failed)\n",
    "on Kickstarter platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main functions \"pred\" and \"pred_once\" included in this Python module. You will learn how to use them quilckly through this instruction and apply them to prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Enjoy using it!_\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "* Platform: Python 3 (version 3.7 recommended)\n",
    "* Packages: numpy, pandas, sklearn and **my_prediction**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Module guideline\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Pred function\n",
    "\n",
    "The function \"Pred\" is used for predicting projects' state with large amount of input data. So you can use it when your input data is saved in a csv file (or similar formats).\n",
    "\n",
    "* __First step:__ import the packages we need and load the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "from my_prediction import my_prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "# load the file to python environment\n",
    "data = pd.read_csv('put the location of your data file here')\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Second step:__ use our module to implement the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "# predict and return the states with corresponding project ID\n",
    "my_prediction.pred(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __If you want to save the results for observation or analysis, type the following for the second step.__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "# output the results and save data in a csv file (choose 'True' for index if you want to display the labels)\n",
    "prediction = my_prediction.pred(data)\n",
    "prediction.to_csv(\"name for your saved file\",index = False,sep = ',')\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Now you may find your saved file in the same folder.__\n",

    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "* Don't forget to copy the whole \"my_prediction\" folder and put it together with your input data, because both the module and the trained machine learning model are included.\n",
